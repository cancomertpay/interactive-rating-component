## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Continued development

This is a simple challenge that serves as a refresher, and I found using the Context API solution to be reasonable since I didn't want to use an external library and complicate the project. In my future projects, I strive to employ optimized techniques and solutions based on React.js, Next.js, and Redux, and I am in a continuous learning phase.
